translation-viewer
==================

In print, a bilingual edition can show its original and its translated
texts [on facing pages][rilke] for comparison.  On the Web, even when
lines are narrow enough to display two paragraphs or stanzas side by
side, there is no easy way to emulate facing pages without modifying
the page's overall layout.

translation-viewer aims to solve this problem.  For now, its goal
is to display a single poem in one or more translations.  Future
versions may add

* prose display,
* pairwise comparison of editions (not just original and translation),
  and
* explicit WordPress support.
